## Sorted Sets
- Sorted sets are a data type which is similar to a mix between a Set and a Hash.
- Sorted sets elements are ordered.
- Every element in a sorted set is associated with a floating point value called a 'score'(this iw why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element is mapped to a value)

## Sorted Sets Commands
- `zadd` - allows you to create a sorted set or add elements to an existing one.
  - `zadd students 1 John 2 Bob`, The 1 and 2 are the scores.
  - `zadd students nx 1 John 2 Bob`, 
  - `zadd students xx 1 John 2 Bob`, 
  - `zadd students ch 1 John 2 Bob`, - ch returns you how many elements changed in your set
  - `zadd students incr 2 Bob`, - increments bob's score to 3.
- `zrange` - print elements in sorted set
  - `zrange students 0 -1`
  - `zrange students 0 -1 withscores`
- `zcard <key>` - checks the cardinality of a sorted set or the amount of elements it holds.
- `zrem`
- `zscore`
- `zrevrange`
- `zrank`
- `zincrby`
- `zcount`
- `zpopmax`
- `zpopmin`
- `zinterstore`
- `zunionstore`
- `zrangebyscore`
- `zrangebylex`
- `zlexcount`
- `zrevrangebylex`
- `zremrangebylex`
- `zremrangebyrank`
- `zremrangebyscore`
